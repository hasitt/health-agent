# Smart Health Agent

A GPU-accelerated personalized health trend analysis and recommendation system focused on Garmin data, with future expansion to food, labs, and genetics.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a minimal yet powerful workflow to analyze Garmin wearable data and deliver personalized, proactive health insights:

- **Garmin data integration:** Analyze HRV, HR, steps, sleep, and activity type.
- **Trend analysis engine:** Identify hourly and daily trends, correlations, and rolling patterns.
- **Insight generation:** Produce proactive text-based summaries (and future visual plots).
- **LLM integration:** Generate natural language explanations on-demand.

The system uses a modular agent design with LangGraph for orchestration and Ollama for LLM capabilities.

## Features

- **Hourly HRV and HR analysis:** Identify rest, low, medium, and high stress trends.
- **Daily activity and sleep correlation:** Understand how activity impacts recovery.
- **Proactive insight push:** Automatic summaries to surprise and delight users.
- **On-demand Q&A:** User asks, system explains trends naturally.
- **Future-ready:** Easy expansion to food tracking, labs, and genetics.

## System Architecture

```
MVP Flow
Garmin API -> Health Metrics Agent -> Insight Engine + Recommendation Agent -> User
```

Future modules may include weather and medical knowledge agents with vector database retrieval.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Ollama installed and running
- Garmin API credentials (using garminconnect package)
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Repository Contents

- `health_metrics_agent.py`: Ingests and preprocesses Garmin data
- `insight_engine.py`: Core statistical and ML analysis logic
- `recommendation_agent.py`: Summarizes insights and interacts with user queries
- `garmin_utils.py`: Helper functions for Garmin API connection

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/smart_health_agent.git
cd smart_health_agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up Garmin credentials using `.env`:

```
GARMIN_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
GARMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Run initial data ingestion:

```bash
python health_metrics_agent.py
```

Start the main application:

```bash
python recommendation_agent.py
```

## Using the Application

After setup, the app analyzes historical Garmin data immediately. Users receive periodic insight summaries and can ask questions like "Why was my HRV low yesterday?".

## Future Roadmap

- Add food tracking
- Incorporate lab and genetics data for advanced personalization
- Introduce graphical trend visualizations (Plotly)
- Weather and environmental context integration
- Fully autonomous recommendation agent with continuous learning

## Technical Notes

Data is structured in a single master timeline DataFrame with hourly granularity. HRV values are hourly means derived from Garmin RMSSD 5â€‘min segments. Sleep scores and stages are joined daily for correlation analysis. The modular design makes it easy to add new agents.
