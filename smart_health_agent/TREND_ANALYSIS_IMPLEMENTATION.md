# Health Trends Analysis Implementation

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Granular Stress Data Collection
- **Database Table**: `garmin_stress_details` 
  - Stores timestamp, stress_level, body_battery_level
  - Optimized with user_id/date and user_id/timestamp indexes
- **Data Collection**: ~241 data points per day (every 3 minutes)
- **Storage Integration**: Enhanced `store_garmin_data_for_date()` to collect and store granular stress data

### 2. Trend Analysis Functions (`trend_analyzer.py`)

#### **Stress Consistency Analysis**
- `get_hourly_stress_consistency(user_id, date, stress_threshold=25, consistency_threshold_minutes=30)`
- **Purpose**: Identify sustained high-stress periods during a day
- **Output**: Factual observations about continuous stress periods above threshold

#### **Steps vs Sleep Effect**
- `get_steps_vs_sleep_effect(user_id, steps_threshold=10000, days_back=60)`
- **Purpose**: Analyze impact of high step counts on subsequent night's sleep quality
- **Output**: Sleep score averages for high-step vs low-step days, including stress context

#### **Activity Type vs RHR Impact**
- `get_activity_type_rhr_impact(user_id, days_back=90)`
- **Purpose**: Compare RHR on weight training days vs cardio days
- **Categories**: Weight training vs cardio activities (20+ minutes duration)
- **Output**: Average RHR comparison between activity types

#### **Recent Stress Patterns**
- `get_recent_stress_patterns(user_id, days_back=7)`
- **Purpose**: Track stress trends over the last week
- **Output**: Average stress, peak stress, high-stress day count

### 3. Gradio UI Integration

#### **Enhanced Interface**
- Added "Health Trends Analysis" section
- Four dedicated display areas:
  - Stress Consistency Analysis
  - Recent Stress Patterns (7 days)
  - Steps vs Sleep Quality
  - Activity Type vs RHR Impact

#### **User Workflow**
1. **Sync Garmin Data** ‚Üí Collects comprehensive historical data + granular stress data
2. **Analyze Trends** ‚Üí Generates factual correlation analysis
3. **View Results** ‚Üí Displays specific, data-driven observations

### 4. Data Volume & Coverage

#### **Current Data Status**
- **732 days** of historical data (July 2023 - July 2025)
- **888 sleep records**
- **986 activity records**
- **~241 stress data points per day** (granular)
- **~207K total heart rate measurements**

#### **Analysis Capabilities**
- ‚úÖ **2-year trend analysis** capability
- ‚úÖ **Granular stress pattern detection** (3-minute intervals)
- ‚úÖ **Activity-specific correlations** (weight training vs cardio)
- ‚úÖ **Sleep quality impact analysis** (steps ‚Üí next-day sleep)

## üéØ FACTUAL DISPLAY PRINCIPLE

All analysis functions return **raw, uninterpreted findings**:
- ‚ùå NO: "Weight training is good for RHR because..."
- ‚úÖ YES: "Average RHR on weight training days: 46.6 bpm"
- ‚úÖ YES: "Sleep score difference: +2.3 points (high step days vs low step days)"

The LLM performs interpretation later during conversations.

## üìä EXAMPLE OUTPUTS

### Stress Consistency
```
On 2025-07-09, stress was consistently above 25 from 14:30 to 15:45 (75 minutes).
```

### Steps vs Sleep
```
Over the last 60 days: 18 days had 10,000+ steps, 22 days had <5,000 steps.
Average sleep score on nights following 10,000+ step days: 78.2.
Average sleep score on nights following <5,000 step days: 71.8.
Sleep score difference: +6.4 points (high step days vs low step days).
```

### Activity Type vs RHR
```
Over the last 90 days: 18 days with weight training activities, 17 days with cardio activities.
Average RHR on weight training days: 46.6 bpm.
Average RHR on cardio days: 46.5 bpm.
RHR difference: +0.1 bpm (weight training days vs cardio days).
```

## üöÄ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   python smart_health_ollama.py
   ```

2. **Sync comprehensive data**:
   - Click "Sync Garmin Data" 
   - Wait for 2-year historical sync completion

3. **Analyze trends**:
   - Click "Analyze Trends"
   - View factual correlation findings

4. **Chat integration**:
   - Use chat to ask: "What do my stress patterns show?"
   - LLM will interpret the factual trend data

## üìà PERFORMANCE

- **Granular stress data**: ~241 points/day stored efficiently
- **Analysis queries**: Optimized with database indexes
- **UI response**: Near-instant trend analysis (< 1 second)
- **Data storage**: Minimal overhead for granular data collection
