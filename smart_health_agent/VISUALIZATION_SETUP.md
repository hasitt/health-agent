# Enhanced Data Visualization Setup Guide

## Overview
The Enhanced Data Visualization feature has been successfully implemented with a new "Graphs" tab in the Gradio UI. This feature provides comprehensive visualizations of your health metrics, correlations, and trends.

## Installation Requirements

### Required Dependencies
The visualization features require matplotlib and seaborn libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

Or using Python module installation:
```bash
python -m pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

### Alternative Installation Methods
If you encounter issues with the above commands, try:

```bash
# Using pip3
pip3 install matplotlib seaborn

# Using conda (if you have conda installed)
conda install matplotlib seaborn

# Install specific versions (as specified in requirements.txt)
pip install matplotlib>=3.7.0 seaborn>=0.12.0
```

## Verification

### Test Installation
Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python test_visualization_setup.py
```

This will check if all required dependencies are installed and available.

### Expected Output
If successful, you should see:
```
✅ matplotlib imported successfully
✅ seaborn imported successfully
✅ health_visualizations imported successfully
```

## Using the Visualization Features

### Accessing Visualizations
1. Start the health agent: `python smart_health_ollama.py`
2. Navigate to the "Graphs" tab in the UI
3. Select your preferred analysis period (30, 60, or 90 days)
4. Click "Generate Visualizations"

### Available Visualizations
The system provides 9 different types of visualizations:

#### Time-Series Metrics
- **Daily Steps & Activity**: Steps count and active calories over time
- **Stress Levels Comparison**: Garmin stress data vs subjective stress ratings
- **Sleep Quality Metrics**: Sleep score and sleep stages distribution

#### Correlation Analysis
- **Hourly Stress Patterns**: Average stress levels by hour of day
- **Sleep Quality vs Timing**: Correlation between sleep quality and bedtime
- **Health Metrics Correlation Matrix**: Correlations between all health metrics

#### Additional Metrics
- **Heart Rate Trends**: Daily resting heart rate with trend analysis
- **Mood Ratings Over Time**: Subjective mood ratings progression
- **Lifestyle Consumption**: Caffeine and alcohol consumption patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'
**Solution**: Install matplotlib as shown above

#### 2. Import Error with seaborn
**Solution**: Install seaborn as shown above

#### 3. Visualization functions not working
**Solution**: 
- Ensure you have health data in the database
- Sync Garmin data first
- Check that you have data for the selected time period

### Graceful Degradation
The application is designed to work even without visualization libraries:
- The main health agent functionality remains available
- The Graphs tab will show installation instructions
- Users can still access all other features (mood tracking, trend analysis, AI insights)

## Features Implemented

### Backend (health_visualizations.py)
- Complete visualization module with 6 main plotting functions
- Base64 encoding for web display compatibility
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Configurable date ranges and styling

### Frontend (Gradio UI)
- New "Graphs" tab with organized layout
- Date range selection dropdown
- 9 image components for different plot types
- Real-time status updates and error handling
- Graceful degradation when libraries are missing

### Key Capabilities
- **Dynamic Data Analysis**: Plots are generated from your actual health data
- **Configurable Time Ranges**: 30, 60, or 90-day analysis periods
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major health metrics and correlations
- **Interactive Experience**: Real-time generation and display
- **Robust Error Handling**: Clear feedback for any issues

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run the pip install commands above
2. **Test Setup**: Run `python test_visualization_setup.py`
3. **Start Application**: Run `python smart_health_ollama.py`
4. **Explore Visualizations**: Navigate to the Graphs tab and generate your first plots

The Enhanced Data Visualization feature is now ready to provide comprehensive insights into your health data patterns and correlations!
