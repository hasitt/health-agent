Project Roadmap: Personalized Health AI Agent
Overall Vision: To create a comprehensive, AI-powered personal health agent that integrates data from various sources (wearables, nutrition trackers, subjective logs, lab tests, genetics) to provide hyper-personalized, actionable, and proactive health insights and coaching.

Phase 1: Foundational Data Integration & Core LLM Setup (Completed/Ongoing in early discussions)
Objective: Establish the basic data pipelines and the initial LLM capability to process health data.

Key Deliverables:

Garmin data integration (already discussed/in progress).

Initial Cronometer data integration (CSV import via dailysummary.csv is a starting point, broader integration to be defined).

Subjective Wellbeing data capture (e.g., mood, energy levels, stress via user input).

LLM setup and basic ability to answer questions about individual data points.

Ability for LLM to display simple data (e.g., "What was my average sleep last week?").

Phase 2: Dynamic Visualization & Basic LLM Insights (Completed/Ongoing)
Objective: Enable the LLM to dynamically generate visualizations and provide initial, rule-based insights.

Key Deliverables:

Dynamic Graph Generation Tool: LLM can request and display various charts (line, bar, scatter plots) based on user queries or self-identified trends across integrated data.

Basic Correlation Insights: LLM can identify simple relationships (e.g., "Your sleep score was lower on days you had late workouts").

Phase 3: Hyper-Personalized, Cross-Metric Insights & Proactive Nudges (Current Focus)
Objective: Develop the LLM's "Health Detective" capabilities to deliver deep, actionable, and personalized insights by synthesizing diverse data, and to proactively alert users to important trends. This phase heavily emphasizes proving value for Garmin users.

Key Deliverables:

Enhanced Interactive Chat Experience: Smooth, intuitive conversational flow, seamlessly integrating LLM responses with dynamic graph displays.

LLM "Health Detective" Reasoning (Core Differentiator):

Recovery Optimization: Analyze Garmin HRV, RHR, Body Battery, and sleep stages, correlating with subjective inputs and activity types to provide actionable recovery advice (e.g., "Low Body Battery after evening strength training combined with poor sleep suggests recovery deficit; consider lighter evening workouts or improved sleep hygiene").

Stress Management: Identify subtle trends and correlations between Garmin stress levels, activity, sleep, and subjective mood/anxiety inputs. Proactively suggest interventions.

Sleep Quality Drivers: Link Garmin sleep metrics with activity, meal timing (from Cronometer data), and subjective inputs to provide personalized sleep hygiene recommendations (e.g., "Late, high-fat meals appear to negatively impact your deep sleep").

Nutrient Deficiency Identification: Leverage dailysummary.csv (and future Cronometer integration) to analyze nutrient intake against recommendations and flag potential deficiencies (e.g., "Consistent low intake of Vitamin D and Iron observed; this could be related to your reported fatigue").

Proactive Nudges (Early Warning System): LLM identifies subtle trends or deviations (e.g., sustained drop in HRV, increase in RHR, unusual stress patterns) and proactively initiates a conversation with personalized context and actionable suggestions.

Initial Lab Data Integration (Backend): Implement data models and import mechanisms for general lab results (e.g., blood markers). This data will be available for LLM interpretation later.

Initial Genetic Data Integration (Backend): Implement data models and import mechanisms for genetic reports. This data will be available for LLM interpretation later.

Supplement Tracker (Simple Logging): Allow users to manually log supplements they are taking (name, dosage, frequency). This will provide the LLM with context on interventions users are attempting.

Phase 4: Advanced Data Integration & Holistic Coaching
Objective: Broaden data sources and deepen the LLM's coaching capabilities with more scientific and evidence-based knowledge.

Key Deliverables:

Vector Database (RAG) Integration:

Integrate a comprehensive health knowledge base (e.g., PubMed abstracts, dietary guidelines, sports science literature, supplement efficacy data) to augment the LLM's responses. This allows for scientifically-backed, evidence-based recommendations beyond just personal data correlations.

Enable LLM to cite sources from the vector database.

Full Lab & Genetic Data Integration (Actionable Insights): The LLM can now interpret lab results and genetic predispositions, correlating them with wearable data, diet, and subjective wellbeing to provide highly specific and actionable health strategies.

Advanced Workout Analytics & Training Optimization: Deeper analysis of Garmin raw workout data (e.g., training load, acute/chronic workload balance, specific workout impacts) combined with sports science knowledge from the RAG system to offer highly sophisticated training and recovery recommendations (similar to WHOOP).

Meal Photo Tracker (Simple Logging + Visual Context): Users can upload meal photos with brief descriptions. The LLM can view the image and description to gain visual context about their food choices (without requiring complex AI recognition initially).

Phase 5: Automated Nutrition & Lifestyle Planning, AI-Powered Food Recognition & Broader Ecosystem
Objective: Automate more aspects of health management and integrate advanced AI for granular nutrition tracking.

Key Deliverables:

Automated Meal Planning: Based on goals, dietary preferences, and nutrient needs/deficiencies, the LLM can generate personalized meal plans.

AI-Powered Food Recognition (Advanced Meal Photo Tracker): Implement computer vision models to automatically identify food items and estimate portion sizes from meal photos, linking them to a comprehensive food database for automatic macro/micro nutrient logging (similar to Cal.ai).

Comprehensive Macro/Micro Estimation (Cronometer-like): A robust system for users to manually search, log, and track individual food items, pulling detailed nutrient data from a large food database.

External Integrations: Weather data, other wearable brands, etc., to provide even broader context for health insights.

Voice-to-Text / Text-to-Speech: Enhance the conversational interface with voice capabilities.
